<!--

	Note that we use GitHub issues for bugs and (uncontroversial) feature
	requests (see below for details).

	Please do *NOT* ask usage questions in GitHub issues.  Usage questions make
	most sense on the users mailing list, where more people are available to
	potentially respond to your question, and the whole community can benefit
	from the answers provided (perhaps your question has already been answered,
	search the archive to find out):
	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-users

	While a GitHub issue is fine to track progress on an uncontroversial
	feature request, many feature requests touch the best practices and
	concepts of Prometheus as a whole and need to be discussed with the wider
	developer community first. This is in particular true for a request to
	reconsider a prior rejection of a feature request or any of the declared
	non-goals (see README.md). Those overarching discussions happen on the
	developer mailing list (GitHub issues, in particular closed ones, are not
	tracked by the wider developer community and thus inadequate):
	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-developers
